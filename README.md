# Propylean.h
Propylean means Process/Production + Python + lean programming
## Objective
The objective of the project is to create a C/C++ header file which will help engineers simulate production plants focusing on chemical and related process industries. 
By coupling this library with available data analysis/machine learning frameworks, engineers will be able to enhace operations of their plants. Ultimate aspiration of this project is to enable process industries transit to zero carbon operation.

Futher documentation will be created on how to utilize this library as project takes shape.

NOTE: This project follows Propylean python library project. For further details please visit Propylean github page https://github.com/abhishekvraman/Propylean.
